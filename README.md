## Typical Workflow

Typically, our editors would navigate to the /files folder at the site root to upload and publish their documents. This is how we organize our site. Then, they would go to their page, into an editable region WYSIWYG, type in the link text, highlight text, and link that text to their document. This workflow caused problems for editors who would upload into the wrong folder, and/or they were not comfortable working in the root. In addition, with Binary Management, the document would not publish until the approval process, so editors could not see a preview of their document.

## New Workflow

This custom gadget allows users to remain in the WYSIWYG while uploading and publishing their document.

## Features
